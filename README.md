# Past Projects
Unfortunately trojan ravaged 8,000 of my files. __Not fun__. Between that and my poor file management systems, not many of my past projects have found their way onto GitHub. :disappointed_relieved: 
That being said, I still have links to the actual products, hosted [here](https://lifedrain28.itch.io/)

## [Block Breaker](https://lifedrain28.itch.io/block-breaker)
Block breaker was my first project using the Unity Game Engine. It's super simple - but it's also pretty fun.

The game is a basic game in which a ball bounces between your paddle and blocks at the top of the screen. If you fail to hit the ball with you paddle - you lose. This game was all about basics. I learned a lot about C# fundamentals, game flow, file management, and the Unity Engine.

## [Bear Brawl](https://lifedrain28.itch.io/bear-brawl)
Bear brawl was my first team-based project and it was awesome to be working as a team. This game is much more advanced than the Block Breaker game.

This game involves two bears, both played by one local keyboard, that fight each other. This game taught me more soft skills than anything else. This project was created for our Java final project - even though the game was written in C#. This game used the Unity engine's built-in collaborative services. I learned a lot about leadership and teamwork, but also some new game development processes such as creating a save file.

## [Stratagem](https://github.com/Stratagem-Studios/Stratagem)
This is the current project I am working on at the moment. Being developed in swift- this game is being worked on by me and the team [Stratagem Studious](https://github.com/Stratagem-Studios). So far I learned quite a bit about Apple's GameKit, SceneKit, and SwiftUI as well as a decent bit of Firebase. This game will mostl likey cease development soon.
