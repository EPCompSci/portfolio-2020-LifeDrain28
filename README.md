# Past Projects
Unfortunately trojan ravaged 8,000 of my files. __Not fun__. Between that and my poor file management systems, not many of my past projects have found their way onto github. :disappointed_relieved: 
That being said, I still have links to the actual products, hosted [here](https://lifedrain28.itch.io/)

## [Block Breaker](https://lifedrain28.itch.io/block-breaker)
Block breaker was my first project using the Unity Game Engine. Its super simple - but its also pretty fun.

The game is a basic game in wich a ball bounces between your paddle and blocks at the top of the screen. If you fail to hit the ball with you paddle - you lose. This game was all about basics. I learned a lot about C# fundametals, game flow, file management, and the Unity Engine.

## [Bear Brawl](https://lifedrain28.itch.io/bear-brawl)
Bear brawl was my first team based project and it was awesome to be working as a team. This game is much more advanced than the Block Breaker game.

This game taught me more soft skills than anything else. This project was created for our Java final project - even through the game was written in C#. This game used Unity engine's buiilt-in collaborative services. I learned a lot about leadership and teamwork, but also some new game development processes such as creating a save file.

## [Untitled Game] by Stratagem Studious
This is the Current project I am working on at the moment. Being developed in swift- this game is being worked on by me and the team [Stratagem Studious](https://github.com/Stratagem-Studios) Unfortunately, this game has no confimed artwork yet.
